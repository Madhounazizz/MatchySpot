# Restaurant Interface Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-01-20

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Routing Issue
- **Problem**: Restaurant users couldn't access the dashboard after login
- **Root Cause**: Conditional routing in `_layout.tsx` was preventing restaurant routes from being registered
- **Solution**: Made both `(tabs)` and `(restaurant)` routes always available when logged in
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/_layout.tsx` - Fixed routing logic
  - `app/auth/login.tsx` - Updated navigation to go directly to dashboard

### 2. Navigation Path
- **Problem**: Login was trying to navigate to `/(restaurant)` which doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Changed navigation to `/(restaurant)/dashboard` which is the actual route
